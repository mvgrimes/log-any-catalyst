=head1 NAME

Log::Any::Adapter::Catalyst - Enable error and status logging in Catalyst Models via Log::Any

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In a Catalyst Model, View, etc (anywhere you don't have C<$c>):

    use Log::Any qw($log);

    $log->debug( "This will go to $c->log() if called from inside Catalyst" );

In a your main Catalyst module (MyApp.pm):

    use Log::Any::Adapter;

    Log::Any::Adapter->set('Catalyst', logger => __PACKAGE__->log);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Log::Any adapter uses L<Catalyst::Log> for logging. L<Catalyst::Log> must
be initialized before calling I<set>, but Catalyst takes care of that for you.
There are no parameters.

=head1 LOG LEVEL TRANSLATION

Log levels are translated from L<Log::Any> to L<Catalyst::Log> as follows:

    trace -> debug
    debug -> debug
    info (inform) -> info
    notice -> info
    warning (warn) -> warn
    error (err) -> error
    critical (crit, fatal) -> fatal
    alert -> fatal
    emergency -> fatal

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Log::Any|Log::Any>, L<Log::Any::Adapter|Log::Any::Adapter>,
L<Catalyst|Catalyst>, L<Catalyst::Log|Catalyst::Log>
