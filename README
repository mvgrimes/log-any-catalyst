NAME
    Log::Any::Adapter::Catalyst - Enable error and status logging in
    Catalyst Models via Log::Any

SYNOPSIS
    In a Catalyst Model, View, etc (anywhere you don't have $c):

        use Log::Any qw($log);

        $log->debug( "This will go to $c->log() if called from inside Catalyst" );

    In a your main Catalyst module (MyApp.pm):

        use Log::Any::Adapter;

        Log::Any::Adapter->set('Catalyst', logger => __PACKAGE__->log);

DESCRIPTION
    This Log::Any adapter uses Catalyst::Log for logging. Catalyst::Log must
    be initialized before calling *set*, but Catalyst takes care of that for
    you. There are no parameters.

LOG LEVEL TRANSLATION
    Log levels are translated from Log::Any to Catalyst::Log as follows:

        trace -> debug
        debug -> debug
        info (inform) -> info
        notice -> info
        warning (warn) -> warn
        error (err) -> error
        critical (crit, fatal) -> fatal
        alert -> fatal
        emergency -> fatal
